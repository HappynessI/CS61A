    "\n",
    "Extend the BankAccount class to include a transactions attribute. This attribute should be a list that keeps track of each transaction made on the account. Whenever the deposit or withdraw method is called, a new Transaction instance should be created and added to the list, even if the action is not successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance of the Transaction class should have the following attributes:\n",
    "- before: The account balance before the transaction.\n",
    "- after: The account balance after the transaction.\n",
    "- id: The transaction ID, which is the number of previous transactions (deposits or withdrawals) made on that account. The transaction IDs for a specific BankAccount instance must be unique, but this id does not need to be unique across all accounts. In other words, you only need to ensure that no two Transaction objects made by the same BankAccount have the same id.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the Transaction class should have the following methods:\n",
    "- changed(): Returns True if the balance changed (i.e., before is different from after), otherwise returns False.\n",
    "- report(): Returns a string describing the transaction. The string should start with the transaction ID and describe the change in balance. Take a look at the doctests for the expected output."
