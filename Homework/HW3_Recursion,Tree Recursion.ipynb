The puzzle starts with n disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on a start rod, the smallest at the top, forming a conical shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to an end rod, obeying the following rules:\n",
    "- Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n",
    "- Each move consists of taking the top (smallest) disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.\n",
    "- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the definition of move_stack, which prints out the steps required to move n disks from the start rod to the end rod without violating the rules. The provided print_move function will print out the step to move a single disk from the given origin to the given destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Draw out a few games with various n on a piece of paper and try to find a pattern of disk movements that applies to any n. In your solution, take the recursive leap of faith whenever you need to move any amount of disks less than n from one rod to another. If you need more help, see the following hints."
